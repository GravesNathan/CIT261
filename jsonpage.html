  <h1>Json</h1>
  <br />
  <h2>What is Json?</h2>
  <p>
    Json is a language often used to store data as it is transmitted between servers.  This is because most languages
    include a method of taking data, changing it into a json string, and then taking the json string and changing
    it back into the original data type.  This allows servers to communicate across different computer lanugages and platforms
    by simply using Json in between.    Also, note that JSON can store strings, numbers, objects, arrays, boolean, and null values.
    It cannot be used for functions, dates, and when a value is undefined.
  </p>
<h2>Json format</h2>
<p>
  A Json string begins and ends with braces.  Inside the braces are name:value pairs separated by commas.
The name of each "name":value pair must be enclosed in quotation marks.  The same is true of string values.
An example Json string would be as follows.<br /><br />

{"name":"John", "age": 50, "height": "6 feet", "hometown:Hillsbarrow"}<br /><br />

Json can also contain arrays by using brackets to enclose the array as part of a value pair.<br /><br />

{"name":"John", "age": 50, "height": "6 feet", "hometown":"Hillsbarrow", "children":["Jacob","Anabell","Bob","Kat"] }
<br /><br />

We can even create an Json string that contains an array which contains objects<br /><br />
{"name":"John", "age": 50, "height": "6 feet", "hometown":"Hillsbarrow","children":[<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;{"name":"Jacob","age":15},<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;{"name":"Anabell","age":14},<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;{"name":"Bob","age":10},<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;{"name":"Kat","age":4}<br />
] }
</p>

<h2>Reading Json data</h2>
<p>
  As you may have noticed the Json format coincides with that of the object format in Javascript.  Likewise, we can reference the information
  contained in a json string much like we would in javascript.  (See example below)<br /><br />

<i>&ltscript&gt<br />
<!--Example read from object-->
var myObj, x;<br />
myObj = { name: "John", age: 30, city: "New York" };<br />
x = myObj.name;<br />
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x;<br />

&lt/script&gt</i><br />
Example taken from https://www.w3schools.com/js/tryit.asp?filename=tryjson_object_access, 10-11-2018
<br /><br />
Note that we could also have used <i>x = myObj["name"];</i>
</p>

<h2>Json Parse</h2>
<p>
   Parsing Json takes a Json string and changes it into an object.  This is done with the JSON.parse method.<br /><br />

<i>
  &ltscript&gt<br />
var txt = '{"name":"John", "age":30, "city":"New York"}'<br />
var obj = JSON.parse(txt);<br />
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = obj.name + ", " + obj.age;<br />
&ltscript&gt<br />
</i>
Result: <b id=parseDemo></b>
<br />
Example from https://www.w3schools.com/js/tryit.asp?filename=tryjson_parse, 10-11-2018
</p>
<script>
var txt = '{"name":"John", "age":30, "city":"New York"}'
var obj = JSON.parse(txt);
document.getElementById("parseDemo").innerHTML = obj.name + ", " + obj.age;
</script>

<h2>Json Stringify</h2>
<p>
  Taking an object (or other data type)  and changing it to a Json format in preparation for transport is know as Stringifying.
  This is done witht he JSON.Stringify method.
