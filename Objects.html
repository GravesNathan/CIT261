  <h1>JavaScript Objects</h1>
  <p>
    <b>Explanation:</b> By this point you should already know that variables in javascript hold data.  In javascript objects are variables that can should
    multiple pieces of data.  We can compare ojects to people, places, or things in real life.  A car has a model, color, and year among other possible properties.
    We can create an object to store these properties, allowing them to be read from and written to during an the execution of a webpage.
  </p>
  <h4>Creation and Properties</h4>
  <p>
    You can define and create an object as follows.<br /><br />
    var newCar = {model:"Saturn",color:"Blue",year:"2019"};
    <br /><br />This would create a variable object named newCar.  The words inside the braces are name:value
    pairs separated by commas, and define what the object newCar contain.<br /><br />
    The values contained in each property can be accessed in the following two formats<br /><br />
    objectName.propertyName or objectName["propertyName"]<br /><br />
  </p>
  <h4>Functions and Object Methods</h4>
  <p>
    In many languages a function is a chunk of code that can be called upon to execute from elsewhere in a program.  JavaScript
    is no different.  In JavaScript Objects can contain methods.  Methods are stored as object properties, but instead of simply
    containing data the property name contains a function.  When the Object method is called the actions programmed in its function
    statement are executed.<br /><br />
    Continuing with our newCar variable from above, lets add a method that will allow us to get the newCar's current model.
    The function would be written as such.<br /><br />
    function(){<br />
      return this.model;<br />
    }<br /><br />
    Or written on one line it would appear as below.<br /><br />
    function(){return this.model;}<br /><br />
    This would then be used as the "data" to be included in the methodName property.<br /><br />
    var newCar = {model:"Saturn",color:"Blue",year:"2019",getModel:function(){return this.model;}};<br /><br />
    Of course this can become a very confusing line so separating an Object into multiple lines as follows is quite common.
    var newCar = {<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;  model:"Saturn",<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;  color:"Blue",<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;  year:"2019",<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;  getModel:function(){<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    return this.model;<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;  }<br />
    };<br /><br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b5>Accessing Object Methods</b5>
    An Object method wouldn't be very usful if you couldn't access it.  Object methods can be accessed using the
    objectName.propertyName format from before but with a slight variation.  If I were to only use objectName.propertyName
    I would get the entire function returned as data.  If I want the actual method to be executed I need to use two
    parenthesis.  This would appear as objectName.propertyName() and is often used in an equation or when assigned to another
    variable. I'll demonstrate with our example.<br /><br />

    </p>
  <script>
    //Creation of object with method
    var newCar = {
      model:"Saturn",
      color:"Blue",
      year:"2019",
      getModel:function(){
        return this.model;
      }
    };
  </script>
