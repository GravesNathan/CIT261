  <h1>JavaScript Basics</h1>
  <p>
    On this page I'll cover some common functions built into most modern programming lanuages.  The topics I'll
    include are loops, conditioanl statements, functions, variables, parameters, arrays, and associative arrays.
    As these topics are widely available I'll provide a simple explanation and a JavaScript example of each.  Credit for
    the examples goes to w3schools.com.
  </p>
  <h2>Loops</h2>
  <p>
    Loops are used to repeat code a certain number of times so long as a condition holds true.  Different
    loop types include do...while, while, for, and for/in loops.  The contnue function can be used to jump out of a current
    loop iteration and begin at the top of the loop.  Break is used to terminate a switch or loop.<br /><br />

    For Loop Example:<br />
    <i>
      var i;<br />
      for (i = 0; i < cars.length; i++) {<br />
          text += cars[i] + "&ltbr&gt";<br />
      }<br />
      //warning that i++ is executed before each iteration in Javascript.  To do it after each iteration we can leave the third statment blank
      and include i++; at the end of the loop.<br />
    </i>
    <br /><br />

    For/in Loop Example:<br />
    <i>
      var person = {fname:"John", lname:"Doe", age:25};<br />

      var text = "";<br />
      var x;<br />
      for (x in person) {<br />
          text += person[x];<br />
      }<br />
      //The for/in loop is used to loop through each of the properties of an object<br />
    </i>
    <br /><br />

    While Loop Example:<br />
    <i>
      while (i < 10) {<br />
          text += "The number is " + i;<br />
          i++;<br />
      }<br />
      //the while loop will execute so long as the test statement is true.  The statement is tested before the first iteration.<br />
    </i>
    <br /><br />

    Do-While Loop Example:<br />
    <i>
      do {<br />
          text += "The number is " + i;<br />
          i++;<br />
      }<br />
      while (i < 10);<br />
      //The do-while loop will execute at least once before the statment at the end is tested.  It will continue to
      repeat so long as the statement is true at the end of each loop.<br />
    </i>
    <br /><br />
  </p>
  <h2>Conditional statements</h2>
  <p>
    The two most popular conditional statements consist of if...else statements and the switch statement.
    These are used to make decisions within a program based on current conditions.  An if...else statement is
    usually preferred for small choices.  A switch statement is often used when many choices are avaialable to
    make code easier to read and use.<br /><br />

    If example<br />
    <i>
    if (hour < 18) {<br />
    greeting = "Good day";<br />
    }<br />
    </i>
    <br /><br />

    If Else example<br />
    <i>
      if (hour < 18) {<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;    greeting = "Good day";<br />
      } else {<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;    greeting = "Good evening";<br />
      }<br />
    </i>
    <br /><br />

    If Else If example<br />
    <i>
      if (time < 10) {<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;    greeting = "Good morning";<br />
      } else if (time < 20) {<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;    greeting = "Good day";<br />
      } else {<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;    greeting = "Good evening";<br />
      }<br />
    </i>
    <br /><br />

    Switch example<br />
    <i>
      switch (new Date().getDay()) {<br />
    case 0:<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;    day = "Sunday";<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;    break;<br />
    case 1:<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;    day = "Monday";<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;    break;<br />
    case 2:<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;    day = "Tuesday";<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;    break;<br />
    case 3:<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;    day = "Wednesday";<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;    break;<br />
    case 4:<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;    day = "Thursday";<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;    break;<br />
    case 5:<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;    day = "Friday";<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;    break;<br />
    case 6:<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;    day = "Saturday";<br />
    default:
    &nbsp;&nbsp;    day = "Something went wrong.  Today doesn't have a defined name.";<br />
      }<br />
    </i>
    Note that the "default" keyboard is used to specify what happens if none of the previous cases matched our test statement.

  <h2>Parameters and Functions</h2>
  <p>
    Functions are a set of instructions that can be carried out whenever the function is called.  This helps reduce
    code redunancy by allowing a single body of code to be executed from anywhere on the page.  A return statement is used
    to exit a function.  It can also be used to return data from within the function to the place it was originally called.
    <br /><br />
    Functions can have parameters in their function statements.  These are placeholder variables that can be used to store
    information that is passed into the function when it is called.  If a function is called with less parameters than those
    that are available in the functions head then the remaining parameters are set to undefined for the function interation.
    <br /><br />
    Simple function<br />
    <i>function myFunction(a, b) {<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;return a * b;<br />
  }</i><br /><br />

    Function call (or invoked)
    <br /><i>
    myFunction(10,2);
  </i><br /><br />
  fullName is an object method (covered in objects page).  The full name function is called using the .call method,
  but is used on the person2 object.<br />
<i>
  var person = {<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;fullName: function() {<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;}<br />
  }<br />
  var person1 = {<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;  firstName:"John",<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;  lastName: "Doe",<br />
  }<br />
  var person2 = {<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;firstName:"Mary",<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;lastName: "Doe",
  }<br />
  person.fullName.call(person2);  // Will return "Mary Doe"<br />
</i><br />
  The apply() method can also be used.  It is similar to the call() function, but takes arguments as arrays.  The call()
  method takes arguments idividually.
  </p>
  <h2>Variables</h2>
  <p>
    Variables differ in javascript in that there is no assigned datatype durin declaration.  Instead the language
    will choose a data type based on the information that is stored.  Variables can be created as follows.<br />
    var x, y, z;
    x = 5;
    y = 6;
    z = x + y;
  </p>

  <h2>Arrays</h2>
  <p>
    Arrays are a type of object which is used to contain a list.  Array entries are assigned numeric values beginning with
    the value of 0 and incremented by 1.  The index is used when refering to specific items in the list.<br /><br />

    Array Syntax:<br />
    <i>var array_name = [item1, item2, ...];</i><br /><br />

    Example:<br />
    <i>var cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];</i><br /><br />

    You can also use the JavaScript "new" keyword to create an new JavaScript Array type object.<br /><br />

    Example<br />
    <i>var cars = new Array("Saab", "Volvo", "BMW");</i>
    <br />
    We can also declare an empty array and then add elements to it.<br />

  </p>
  <h2>Associative Arrays</h2>
  <p>
    It is important to note that JavaScript doesn't provide support for associative arrays.  If we try to create an associative array
    JavaScript will instead interpret it as an object.  This will also produce confusion because we cannot use .length or other
    standar array notations properly.  If you're looking for a key:value pairing it is better to simply create a proper object which
    is covered in the object section.
    <br /><br />
    <i>
    Bad "Associative" Array example (Don't use)<br />
    var person = [];<br />
    person["firstName"] = "John";<br />
    person["lastName"] = "Doe";<br />
    person["age"] = 46;<br />
    var x = person.length;         // person.length will return 0<br />
    var y = person[0];             // person[0] will return undefined<br />
  </i><br />
    Note that person["firstName"] will work, but creating an object properly is still recommended.
